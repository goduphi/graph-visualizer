# Graph Visualizer

I am a visual learner who appreciates a visual representaion of any type of problem. In an attempt to furthur understand how tree data structures work,
I decided to create a visualizer that cemented my understanding of graphs.

Note: I am not following any tutorials for the visualizer itself. The only piece of code that looked up was the code for creating the grid which is linked
in the code.

# Dependencies
- pygame [pip install pygame]
